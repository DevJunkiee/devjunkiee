# Hi, I’m Michael 👋

I’m a Product Engineer focused on building **AI, automation, and robotics systems** that solve real-world problems.

My work involves designing and prototyping end-to-end systems, combining software, control logic, and intelligent decision-making. I care deeply about building things that actually work under real constraints.

### Areas of interest
- Automation systems
- AI-assisted workflows
- Robotics-oriented prototypes
- Applied system design & experimentation

### Current focus
- Documenting real systems and experiments
- Publishing technical write-ups and demos
- Preparing applied research and open projects
